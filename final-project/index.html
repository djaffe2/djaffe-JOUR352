<p> On May 21, 1998, before places like Columbine and Newtown and Parkland had become part of the American vernacular, Kristin Kinkel received a phone call. At the time, she was twenty-one and a student at Hawaii Pacific University, in Honolulu. She had a scholarship for competitive cheerleading—she was an expert tumbler and flyer—and she lived with some of her teammates in a modest rental house they called Cheer Palace.</p>

<p>The phone call came early that morning from a friend from her home town—Springfield, Oregon. He stammered something about having bad news and hung up. Soon afterward, another friend called and told her that there had been a shooting at Thurston High School, where Kristin had gone and where her brother, Kip, was in ninth grade. “Is Kip hurt?” she asked. She didn’t get an answer. Then a third friend phoned and blurted out what nobody else wanted to say: Kip was the one who had opened fire at Thurston. As Kristin would later learn, he had killed two students and injured another twenty-five.</p>

<p>Someone told her to check the news; the story was dominating CNN. “I remember turning on the TV and seeing my house, the house I grew up in, from a helicopter view, ” Kristin recalled recently. Her parents had built the house twenty-five years earlier—an A-frame surrounded by Douglas firs. Now it was a crime scene. After the shooting at Thurston, the police had discovered two bodies inside her family’s home—her brother had killed their parents, too.</p>

<p>The phone kept ringing. One of Kristin’s childhood friends in Oregon had heard an early news report that mistakenly said three bodies had been found in the family’s house—not two. The friend was terrified: Had Kristin been killed as well? “I ended up calling her roommates in Hawaii,” the friend remembered. “And they were, like, ‘She’s here. She’s fine. But she’s not talking to anyone.’ ”</p>

<p>Cheer Palace was in a quiet part of Honolulu, at the end of a street, but soon media vans were parked outside. To avoid being seen through the front windows, Kristin hid on the stairs in the back. “I remember sitting there on the top of the stairs, with my head in my hands, waiting,” she said. While her roommates tried to figure out what to do, her brain kept sputtering, trying to make sense of the news: “This can’t be true, there’s no way this is true, this is completely impossible.” </p>

<p>To help Kristin escape, a male teammate sneaked her into his truck and drove away. Unsure where she should go, Kristin tracked down a surfer friend. “Can you please take me out into the ocean?” she asked. She remembers lying on a board in the water, “just trying to come to terms with everything.” As the waves rocked her body, her mind was able to focus, and then she heard a siren in the distance. “There was something about that moment when it settled—I really did have to believe it, I can’t ignore it, I can’t pretend that this didn’t happen,” she said.</p>

<p>The police took Kip into custody at Thurston High School and the next day escorted him into a courtroom at the Lane County courthouse, in Eugene. He was fifteen, with reddish-brown hair and acne, and was wearing a University of Oregon sweatshirt. His wrists were cuffed in front of him, his ankles shackled, his head down. As he was led past the media, the snapping sound of camera shutters erupted. “Kip, what do you want to tell your sister?” someone shouted. He did not respond. In court, he was charged as an adult with four counts of aggravated murder. </p> 
        
<p>Kristin’s university paid for her airplane ticket home, and a male teammate accompanied her, making certain that she wasn’t besieged by reporters. She could not return to her family’s house—the police were still there investigating—so she stayed with a friend’s family. Her parents had had a large circle of friends, and somebody had already called Don Loomis, an attorney who handled estates, suggesting that Kristin would need a lawyer. The night after she arrived, Loomis met with her.</p>        

 <p>She appeared to be in shock, which he had expected, but her words about her brother took him aback. “That’s not Kip,” she said. “There must be something wrong.” She insisted that they needed to figure out what was wrong with Kip—and find a way to help him. “I think she just knew that it wasn’t the Kip that she remembered,” Loomis said.</p>
        
<p>Kristin set about planning a funeral for her parents, which was held on May 27th. By then, seven days had elapsed since Kip had murdered them, and Kristin had already visited him at the local juvenile jail three times. “One of the first times I saw him, I just remember him being unable to talk,” she said. “He had his head down on the table, and he was crying, and the only thing he could say was ‘I’m sorry.’ ” </p> 
        
<p>To read the media coverage of Kip Kinkel’s crimes today is to be reminded of how shocking they were at the time—and how numb we have become to such acts of violence in the past quarter century. Mass school shootings were almost unheard of before the 1997-98 school year. That year, there were a handful—including in West Paducah, Kentucky, and near Jonesboro, Arkansas—and then Kip’s shooting eclipsed them all: he had opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle in a packed cafeteria. “Something like this was unimaginable at that point in time,” Peter DeFazio, who lives near Thurston High School and represented the area in Congress, told me. “It was before this became an American epidemic.” </p>
        
<p> Springfield—a small, blue-collar city that had long been known for its timber industry—now found itself on front pages, its reputation redefined by the extreme violence of a teen-ager. The media had arrived en masse, with satellite trucks taking over the road in front of Thurston. Students and townspeople gathered at the fence in front of the school to grieve, leaving flowers, ribbons, notes, candles, and stuffed animals along the chain links. Today, the creation of a makeshift memorial in the wake of a school shooting might be expected, but then it was still a novelty, the beginning of a new American ritual.</p> 

<p>An anti-violence campaign started in Springfield, with an optimistic slogan: “Let it end here.” On June 13th, President Bill Clinton visited Thurston, where he spoke in the school’s gym. “This has not only been a horrible and traumatic experience for you—this has been a traumatic experience for all of America,” he said. “Everybody who has looked at you knows that this is a good community that they’d be proud to live in, and, therefore, it could happen anywhere.” Ten months later, two teen-agers in Colorado launched an attack so deadly that it became known by a single word: Columbine. </p>  
        
<p>After that, more mass shootings took place each year, and following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, I started thinking about Kip Kinkel and his sister. Unlike the shooter at Sandy Hook or those in Columbine, Kip was still alive, and, I thought, he and Kristin might be able to provide some insight into the tragedy enveloping the country. After speaking to a couple of media outlets in 1998 and 1999, Kristin had refused every interview request, and when I reached out to her she turned mine down, too. I assumed that I would never hear from her again, but, this past April, ten years after I contacted her, she told me that she wanted to talk. </p>

<p>The first time I spoke to her, on the phone, it was apparent that she was still deeply traumatized. “Forgive the shakiness in my voice,” she said. She explained that part of her trepidation was owing to her past interactions with the press, which included reporters pursuing her at the courthouse. “I was not a human being to the media,” she said. “I was a story that everyone wanted to get.” I wondered if at some point she would change her mind about talking to me, but she never wavered, and we got into a routine of speaking each week. </p>

<p>Our first interview took place on May 8th—her mother’s birthday. Many years ago, Kristin told me, a therapist had helped her devise a ritual to cope with the loss of her parents: on their birthdays, she carries an object that reminds her of them. For her father, the object was a tennis ball, because tennis was his favorite sport. For her mother, who had long red hair, it was a silver butterfly hair clasp. At the moment, Kristin said, she was carrying the clasp in the “kangaroo pouch” of her sweatshirt. “I’m holding it right now,” she said. </p>
        
 <p>I was surprised by her willingness to be so candid with a stranger. It seemed that part of her decision to speak with me had to do with timing—this year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of her brother’s crimes. In the past, she had worried that anything she said publicly might bring more pain to the families of the students Kip had shot, but now that a quarter century had passed she hoped this was less likely. I also sensed that her decision to tell her story was driven in large part by a desire to help her brother. He remains in prison, but they are still in close contact. “The thing you heard a few minutes ago”—a beep on the phone line—“was him trying to call,” she said. </p>
        
<p>After the shootings, Kristin had made a point of not reading the media coverage, but the story was headline news across the country. Kip had shot their parents on May 20, 1998, then spent the night at the house. The next day, shortly before 8 a.m., he had walked toward Thurston High School wearing a trenchcoat and carrying a semi-automatic rifle and two pistols. He had started firing the rifle in a breezeway, opened the door to the cafeteria, and continued firing, pausing only when he ran out of ammunition. Jacob Ryker, a junior on the wrestling team who had been shot in the chest, tackled him, and several other boys joined in, pinning him to the cafeteria floor. A custodian later told police that he heard Kip shout, “Kill me!” </p>  
        
<p>Kip had fired fifty-one rounds, shooting students in the head, neck, buttocks, thigh, hip. Mikael Nickolauson, seventeen, died at the school; sixteen-year-old Benjamin Walker died in a hospital. Among the students most critically injured was Tony Case, a pitcher on the varsity baseball team and a trombonist in the school’s jazz band. He had been in the cafeteria that morning handing out campaign stickers for a friend running for student-body president. When he realized what was happening, he dived under a table, but Kip shot him three times in the back and once in the leg.</p>

<p>Life published a ten-page story about the shooting victims, which included a photograph of Tony in his hospital bed. One of the surgeons who operated on him was quoted as saying, “I thought he was going to die.” After two weeks in the hospital, Tony came home to bags of get-well cards from all over the country. A few had been addressed simply to “Tony Case, Springfield, Oregon.” Some were made of construction paper and signed by classrooms of children; others had been sent by youth baseball teams.</p>
        
<p>Kip Kinkel had opened fire at Thurston on a Thursday. The following Tuesday, the school reopened, with the cafeteria cleaned up. Tony, a junior, did not return until the following school year. “I can’t move my right foot and still can’t feel in my right foot and ankle,” he told a reporter three months after he was shot. “The doctors are just, like, ‘Wait and see.’ ” Tony said that he had not “felt any anger” toward Kip: “I think pretty much what everybody thinks—there’s a sick kid for you, and he pretty much needs to stay in jail for the rest of his life.”
